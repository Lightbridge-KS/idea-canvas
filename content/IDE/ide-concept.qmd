## IDE Concept

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="false"}
I'd like to build a human-centered AI application for radiologist. The one that came into my mind is a specialized IDE for radiologist for writing a radiology report. What do you think?

A specialized IDE for radiologists to write reports is an excellent idea with real practical value. Let me share some thoughts on how this could transform radiology workflows:

**Core Value Proposition**

The current report writing process is often fragmented - radiologists switch between PACS viewers, dictation software, and reporting systems. An integrated IDE could unify this workflow while adding AI-powered assistance tailored to radiological practice.

**Key Features to Consider**

1. **Smart Templates with Context Awareness**
   - AI that suggests report structures based on imaging modality and clinical indication
   - Dynamic templates that adapt to findings as you describe them
   - Automatic population of technical parameters from DICOM metadata

2. **Intelligent Autocomplete**
   - Medical terminology suggestions specific to the body part and pathology
   - Phrase completion based on your personal reporting style
   - Measurement assistance (e.g., automatically suggesting comparison to prior studies)

3. **Real-time Quality Checks**
   - Flag potential inconsistencies or missing critical findings
   - Ensure all relevant structures are addressed
   - Check for laterality errors or contradictions

4. **Visual Integration**
   - Side-by-side image viewing with report editing
   - Click-to-insert functionality for measurements and annotations
   - Automatic screenshot capture for key findings

5. **Evidence-Based Recommendations**
   - Inline access to relevant guidelines (BI-RADS, LI-RADS, etc.)
   - Differential diagnosis suggestions based on described findings
   - Follow-up recommendations based on current standards

**Technical Implementation Considerations**

Given your background, you could start with:

- **Backend**: Python FastAPI for the server, integrating with existing PACS/RIS systems via HL7/FHIR
- **Frontend**: Web-based interface using React/TypeScript for flexibility
- **AI Models**: Fine-tuned language models for radiology-specific text generation and NLP
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for report storage with full-text search capabilities

**Potential Challenges**

- Integration with existing hospital systems (PACS, RIS, EMR)
- Ensuring HIPAA compliance and data security
- Gaining trust from radiologists who may be skeptical of AI assistance
- Handling the variety of reporting styles and preferences
