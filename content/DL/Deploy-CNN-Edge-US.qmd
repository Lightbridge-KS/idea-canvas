# CNN Edge Device Deployment

You can deploy your CNN model to portable ultrasound devices! This is increasingly common in point-of-care ultrasound applications. Here's a practical overview:


## Deployment Overview


### 1. Model Optimization Pipeline

```
Original Model (PyTorch/TF/JAX)
         |
         v
    Optimize/Quantize
         |
         v
   Convert to Edge Format
    (ONNX, TensorRT, 
     TFLite, CoreML)
         |
         v
   Deploy to Device
```

**Key steps:**
- Quantization (FP32 → INT8/FP16) to reduce model size and speed up inference
- Pruning unnecessary weights
- Knowledge distillation if model is too large
- Convert to edge-optimized runtime format


### 2. Technical Approach


**Path A: SDK-Based Integration**
```
Your Model → Ultrasound SDK → Device Software
```
- Use manufacturer's software development kit
- Integrate as plugin or custom algorithm module
- Examples: Butterfly iQ+, Clarius have SDKs


**Path B: External Processing**
```
US Device → Stream Images → Edge Computer → Display Results
         (WiFi/USB)      (Jetson/NUC)
```
- Ultrasound streams images to companion device
- Separate edge computer runs your model
- More flexibility but requires hardware integration


**Path C: Cloud-Hybrid**
```
US Device → Upload → Cloud Processing → Return Results
```
- Less ideal for real-time, but easier initial deployment
- Useful for non-critical screening scenarios


### 3. Hardware Requirements


For edge deployment, you need:
- **Compute:** GPU/NPU for CNN inference (5-50ms latency target)
- **Memory:** 2-8GB depending on model size
- **Storage:** For model weights (typically 50-500MB)
- **Interface:** API to access ultrasound image stream


### 4. Device Categories


**Open Platform Devices** (Easier integration)
- Research-grade ultrasound with developer access
- Allow custom software installation
- Examples exist but I'll need to search for specifics

**Commercial Devices with SDK**
- Limited but growing options
- Require partnership or developer program

**Custom Hardware Solution**
- Build around existing ultrasound transducer modules
- Most control but most complex


### 5. Practical Considerations


**Regulatory:**
- FDA/CE marking required for clinical use
- Class II medical device in most jurisdictions
- May need clinical validation studies

**Performance:**
- Real-time inference (<100ms) for good UX
- Model size typically <100MB for mobile deployment
- Accuracy maintenance after quantization


### 6. Development Workflow


```
1. Optimize Model
   ├─ Quantize to INT8
   ├─ Test accuracy retention
   └─ Convert to ONNX/TFLite

2. Prototype on Companion Device
   ├─ Jetson Nano/Xavier NX
   ├─ Raspberry Pi + Coral TPU
   └─ Test with recorded US videos

3. Integrate with US Hardware
   ├─ Access image stream
   ├─ Run inference
   └─ Display results overlay

4. Validate & Iterate
   ├─ Latency testing
   ├─ Clinical accuracy validation
   └─ User experience testing
```


## Immediate Next Steps


1. **Model optimization:** Convert your model to ONNX and test inference speed
2. **Benchmark:** Test on edge hardware (Jetson Nano is good starting point)
3. **Research devices:** I can search for specific ultrasound options that support third-party algorithms
